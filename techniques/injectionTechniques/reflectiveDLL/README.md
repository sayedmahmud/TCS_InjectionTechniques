## To Run
- Must have the domain mal_download.com linked to a host that we control.
    - for testing an entry was added to the hosts file under c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
- The program reaches out to the http://mal_download.com/spawn_calc.dll to download a DLL which will be loaded in memory and executed.
- Current spawn_calc.dll was generated by metasploit. Replace with reverse shell to get a shell back
